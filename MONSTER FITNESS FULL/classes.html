                <br><br> Yoga is an extraordinary spiritual science of self-development and self-realization that shows us how to develop our full potential in our many-sided lives. It was first devised by the rishis and sages of ancient India and has
                been maintained by a stream of living teachers ever since, who have continually adapted this science to every generation.
                <br><br> ‘Yoga is to keep the mind balance and equanimous in all vicissitudes of life’.

                deems to be the 10 components of physical fitness: cardiovascular/respiratory endurance, stamina, strength, flexibility, power, speed, coordination, agility, balance, accuracy.<br>

            <h1>Mixed Martial Arts</h1>
            <p>Mixed martial arts, also known as MMA, is a term for the combat sport in which two competitors attempt to achieve dominance over one another by utilizing three general tactics: striking, finishing holds, and control. The rules allow the combatants
                to use a variety of martial arts techniques including punches, kicks, joint-locks, chokes, takedowns and throws. Victory is normally gained through knock-out, submission , or stoppage by the referee, the fight doctor, or a competitor’s
                cornerman.
                <br><br> It is no longer an accurate description of the modern competitions which utilize many more rules than before. The first Ultimate Fighting Championship’s only rules were against eye-gouging, fish-hooking and biting.
